# pyspark_exercises
A few pyspark exercises from an udemy course I'm doing, learning to use some basic functions from pyspark.

Important:
These lines were encoded using Pyspark, a Spark API for python, I used databricks notebook, but there are other ways to use pyspark, like a virtual machine for example. At this moment the results aren't well displayed when open the notebook here in github, I will try to fix that.
