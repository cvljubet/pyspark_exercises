# pyspark_exercises
A few pyspark exercises from an udemy course I'm doing, learning to use some basic functions from pyspark and the pyspark machine learning library.

Note1: 
Pyspark is a Spark API for python, it helps us work with big data, but the exercises I'm doing uses short datasets because the main target here is to learn some comands.

Note2:
I used databricks cluster to code these notebook (free version).
